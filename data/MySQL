MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/ "My S-Q-L")[5] is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS).[6] Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.
